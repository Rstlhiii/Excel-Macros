The following code will print the pivot table once for each item in the first Report Filter field. Use the PrintPreview line for testing. When ready to print, remove the apostrophe from the beginning of the ActiveSheet.PrintOut line, and add an apostrophe to the beginning of the ActiveSheet.PrintPreview line.
